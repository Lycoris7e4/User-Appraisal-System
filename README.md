# User Appraisal System

This is a personal project aimed at practicing some specific syntax of C# and practical development with .NET6 Framework and WinForms. The project simulates a User Appraisal Management System, which allows real-time viewing of user information, annual appraisal statistics, and updating the database through a graphical interface.
